These days, that's the bare minimum. By partnering with Nursify Education, your current & future students won't just remember their education with you, but celebrate it." },
    { id: 2, text: 'Save Your Students', image: '/2.jpg', description: "Every student invests their hard-earned, and often borrowed, money in you in exchange for the best education possible. Nurses want to be confident, knowledgeable, and set up for success, not just for their first job, but their entire career. Nursify Education has identified crucial skills nurses must know to avoid workplace injury and burnout." },

This is exactly why Nursify Education provides cost-effective, fiscally responsible, value-packed offers that are custom to your needs and economic capacities." },

We can help you and your teams be leaders in, and champions of, patient satisfaction!" },

It can then take years to recover from burnout. Myriad factors lead to nurses burning out, but 3 of the top 10 are: 1) Physical Demands 2) Injury 3) Lack of Support. We have found ways to address each of these issues in our 9-module certification course. This costs an arm and a leg ONLY if you choose NOT to partner with us." },

With the nursing shortage expected to worsen through at least 2030, championing them has to go beyond words of appreciation and small celebrations of milestones. To keep your best; you must invest. By partnering with Nursify Education, the payoff is enormous and the investment is minimal. What they learn from us will speak volumes for how much you care for their well-being and treasure them for being them." },

It is the core of what we achieve with everyone who gets certified in our 9-module Transfer & Mobility course. This is the only evidence-based course of its kind, and teaches your nurses skills they never learned in school, unless the school is one of our cherished partners." }

You only get ONE body and if you get hurt, you're either putting yourself at greater risk of bigger injury or limiting your ability to help all your current and future patients." },
