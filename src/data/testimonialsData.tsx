You expounded very effectively the role of the OT and demonstrated transfer skills, adaptation, and how the nurse could definitely be more efficient by learning some of the patient transfer skills that OT knows. When your presentation time was up, we wanted and needed more.  Phil your presentation was professional, fun, friendly, and absolutely engaging.  So good, in fact, that I would love to involve your department each semester for the IPE activity in the 4th  semester, if possible, or, at least, each Spring semester.  Is this something we could plan for? Please know how much we appreciate you taking the time to help me with IPE. It was a synergistic and beneficial collaboration between nursing and occupational therapy for sure. Thank you again for sharing your expertise and supporting a fabulous IPE learning experience for our students.'
