        description: 'Nursify Education was born out of a passion for helping others accomplish demanding tasks efficiently and overcoming overwhelming obstacles they didn’t believe they could master. We have successfully educated, coached, and mentored hundreds of healthcare professionals and wanted to find a way to grow from helping hundreds to helping tens of thousands. Our passion has allowed us to transform people’s lives who are then empowered to more confidently change the lives of the people around them, particularly their patients.'
